An implementation of a Gossip fault detection protocol in a general framework setting for embedding within a custom server. Using fbthrift for server-2-server RPC. Will try to use Interval-Tree-Clocks (ITC) for causality determination (http://haslab.uminho.pt/cbm/files/itc.pdf)

Based on clean C++11 coding standards.
